                When we set our wedding date we certainly didn't expect to be dealing with a global pandemic! After 100+ days of sheltering in place, we are very much looking forward to getting married and having something to CELEBRATE!           
                 <br/><br/>
                 We will be working closely with the church, the reception venue, and our vendors to ensure we are following appropriate safety guidelines throughout the day.                <br/>
            </p>
            <p>With Love,<br/>

                As we get closer to the day of the wedding, we will continue to update this page with concrete details on the measures we're taking to ensure we're creating a safe environment to celebrate with friends and family. As of Jul 1, 2020--
            </p>
            <h4>The Day Of</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>We ask that anyone with a fever or who is feeling sick please stay at home</li>
                <li>We ask that all guests bring a face mask. We will also have additional masks available for guests at both the ceremony and reception</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Ceremony at Holy Trinity Catholic Church</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pews will be marked off to ensure 6' distance between guests </li>
                <li>Guests will be asked to wear masks throughout the ceremony</li>
                <li>Plexiglass placed in front of individuals on the altar and the choir loft where a face mask may not be worn (e.g. readings)</li>
                <li>We will be working with the staff to understand what best practices they've developed since opening the church for limited capacity in mid-June</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>The Reception at The Venue at Daisy Hill</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Guests will be asked to wear masks when possible, although we understand eating and drinking will require the removal of masks at times</li>
                <li>Tables will seat 8 guests and be spaced farther apart than normal. Family groups will be seated together</li>
                <li>We will have elements of the reception outside where possible (the venue is on a large piece of land)</li>
                <li>We are looking into tenting a space outside to have a larger air conditioned space available for guests (it will be HOT in September)</li>
                <li>Dinner will be seated</li>
                <li>Drinks may only be served as table service. We are still evaluating whether this may be better practice than a socially distanced line at a bar</li>
                <li>All service staff will wear masks (e.g. waiters, DJ)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We've committed to getting married on September 5th and will do everything in our power to ensure the day is as safe and comfortable as possible for everyone who is able to attend.</p>
            <p>Unless the State of Georgia declares a ban on gatherings (which seems unlikely at this point...but 2020 has been full of surprises), we will plan to have our ceremony and reception. We will also continue to update this page as we refine our COVID action plan.</p>
