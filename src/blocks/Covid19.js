                When we mailed our wedding invitations, the daily number of new COVID cases in Georgia was stable and we were optimistic that we could safely and responsibly host a large gathering at the end of the summer. However, in the weeks since the invitations went out COVID cases in Georgia and many other states have accelerated. The pandemic has gone from bad to worse.           
                <br/><br/>
                We’re broken hearted, but <strong>we have decided to shrink our wedding to include only immediate family and our wedding party.</strong>
                <br/><br/>
                Everyone we sent an invitation to is someone we love dearly and with who we wished to share this moment. But, that also makes you the people who we want to keep healthy and well right now. We can’t in good conscious host a large gathering while the virus is out of control.
                <br/><br/>
                One day, hopefully sooner rather than later (looking at you 2021!), we hope to bring together the most important people in our lives to celebrate our marriage. Until we can safely see you in person, we welcome your love and well wishes from afar as we start our life together!
                <br/><br/>
                We’re working to set up a <strong>live stream of our wedding</strong> for those who wish to attend virtually, stay tuned! We will update our wedding website with further information once we’ve got it set up.
                <br/><br/>
                In March, as the scope of this global pandemic became clear, we committed to getting married on September 5th, 2020. We are so ready to start our life together. There has been a lot of bad over the last few months, but these times have also confirmed that we’re making the right choice choosing each other.
                <br/><br/>
                You may not be there with us on September 5th, but please know we will be thinking about you. And we cannot WAIT to see you again and to celebrate together.
            </p>
            <p>With Love,<br/>
